/**
 * @title VersionedInitializable
 *
 * @dev Helper contract to implement initializer functions. To use it, replace
 * the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier.
 * WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually
 * invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well
 * as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance.
 * WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke
 * a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent,
 * because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.
 *
 * This is slightly modified from [Aave's version.](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/6a503eb0a897124d8b9d126c915ffdf3e88343a9/contracts/protocol/libraries/aave-upgradeability/VersionedInitializable.sol)
 *
 * @author Lens Protocol, inspired by Aave's implementation, which is in turn inspired by OpenZeppelin's
 * Initializable contract
